Welcome! This is a small but heartfelt game I built using Pygame as a gift for my girlfriend. The player journeys through 10 levels and faces a final boss battle to complete the game.

This was a personal passion project. The repository is slightly different from the actual codebase because of me having to port it to GitHub. I hope it brings joy to anyone who tries it!
